The Framework documentation should be:

* **Clear** -  The documentation is easy to read. It’s concise, specific, and organized. And it’s simple, not oversimplified, so readers can get the information they need without wasting time or effort.

* **Accessible and inclusive** - We strive to write for everyone. We make sure our content is for beginners to advanced readers. We avoid language that isolates or excludes others. And we make sure our content is available to people with a diverse range of hearing, movement, sight, and cognitive abilities.

* **Correct** - Work hard to make sure the documentation you are writing is accurate. Others rely on your expertise, so provide the best information you have at the time. 

## Inclusivity

Avoid using language that isolates or excludes. For example, don’t reference a person’s age, disability, or gender unless it’s relevant. Here are some other guidelines to keep in mind.

**Do**

* If you need to mention a disability, ask whether the person or people being referenced prefer person-first language (“they have a disability”) or identity-first language (“they are disabled”).
* Use gender neutral language whenever possible.
* If you’re writing about a hypothetical person, use they or them instead of he/she. He/she is tedious to read and doesn’t account for people with non-binary gender identities.

**Don’t**

* Don’t refer to people using age-related descriptors like young, old, or elderly.
* When writing about a person with disabilities, don’t use the words suffer, victim, or handicapped.

## Colloquialisms, idioms, humor, and metaphor

Slang, humor, regional phrases, and metaphor can be confusing, even to native speakers, and rarely translate well. Expressions like “an app portfolio is a complex beast” are not universally understood or appreciated, and it’s hard to find equivalent meanings in other languages. So it's usually best to avoid language with implied or regional meaning. That includes anthropomorphism, a type of metaphor that attributes human characteristics or behavior to non-humans.

## Links, URLs, and websites

We discuss and direct people to online locations and resources a lot, so let's do it right.

### Descriptive hypertext

Descriptive link text makes navigation easier and more efficient because it’s easier to skim and allows users to make informed decisions about whether to follow them. Using the article title is the easiest ways to do this.
